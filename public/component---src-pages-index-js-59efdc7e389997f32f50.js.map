Luya (Tagalog for “ginger”) is used as both a spice\n          and a remedy across many cultures, and we bring this spirit of\n          nourishment and healing to every workshop, performance, and open mic\n          space we create. We believe deeply in using poetry to bring\n          communities of color together, to build solidarity around the issues\n          that are important to us, and to reclaim our cultures and histories.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Our monthly spoken word open mic series is a welcoming space for poets\n          of color to express themselves to an audience that understands where\n          they’re coming from. Whether you're a spoken word veteran, or someone\n          just starting to find your voice, we're here for you. Perform with or\n          without music, alone or in a group, stick to the theme or don’t – all\n          we ask is that you bring your whole self to the mic. Organized by\n          multidisciplinary artists from the Asian diaspora, our open mic aims\n          to bring the community together, and showcase local Chicago-area\n          talent.
